Add two reducers  to the transactions slice: "deposit" and "transfer".
Both reducers update the balance and then record the transaction.

"deposit" should increase the balance by the amount in the payload,
while "transfer" should decrease the balance by the amount in the payload.

Refer to the "withdrawal" reducer, which is already implemented for you.
